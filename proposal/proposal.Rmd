## Section 1. Introduction


The dataset we are using is “TMBD 5000 Movie Dataset.” 

Originally, we found this set on kaggle.com. The data originates from “The Movie Database” API, it was collected from this original dataset.

The data’s variables: 
budget
genres
homepage
id
keywords
original_language
original_title
overview
popularity
production_companies
production_countries
release_date
revenue
runtime
spoken_languages
status
tagline
title
vote_average
Vote_count

Our research question would be, what variables correlate to a high popularity (variable = popularity) rate?
